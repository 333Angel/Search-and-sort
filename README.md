# Search-and-sort
Something done for my school. It allows you to name a list, and then it prints out for you a list of groceries. You can then modify the list in various ways.

prompt I recieved:

"Write a “useful” program that creates, uses and possibly modifies a list of String items, for example a grocery list or a to do list. Allow a user to SEARCH (sequential/linear) through the list to see if an item is already on it. If it is, print that it is already on the list, if it is not ask if the user wants to add it to the list. Once the person is done searching and editing the list, print the list in its original form, then SORT and print the list in alphabetical order."
